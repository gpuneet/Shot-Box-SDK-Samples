The Wasp3D SDK helps developers create custom solutions for Broadcast & Interactive graphics. Live Event Graphics Developers can use the API to data-bind wasp scenes to various sources of data, scoring applications, wire feeds and databases and push it to the Wasp3D rendering engine - Sting Server for on-air playout

The Wasp3D Shotbox is a simple API that gives users a high level control over the Sting Server. The API provides classes for developers to load and meld data with wasp design templates on Sting Server. The API wraps the underlying protocol for communication through helper functions, enabling developers to create custom solutions for Broadcast & Interactive graphics. You can connect to multiple Sting-Server(s) using different communication channels. You can create from simple to complex applications managing multiple scenes on multiple Sting-Server(s) from a single application using WASP3D Shotbox SDK.
